# Implementation Code

We've included the notebook used to run the Dreamer v3 implementation on the MiniWorld environments. The uploaded notebook is based on the Hallway environment; to run other MiniWorld environments, one would simply have to change the task under "MiniWorld" in the config.yaml file of dreamerv3-torch-DRL. We did not include the notebooks for the other environments because their training runs were stopped at much later timesteps, and they are therefore too large.
